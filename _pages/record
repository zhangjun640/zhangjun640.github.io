Summer volunteer teaching in Zhangjiajie: 
======
  * During the summer of 2023, as the team leader, I led a group of 10 volunteers to my hometown, Zhangjiajie, for a summer volunteer teaching program. I was responsible for leading the team and coordinating with local schools.
  * My main focus was on middle school students, introducing them to the basics of Python to help them become familiar with computers and spark their interest in programming.

Charity sale:
======
  * From 2022 to 2023, I organized multiple charity sales to bring warmth to children in remote areas. The funds we raised went toward providing school supplies and educational support for these children in underserved mountain regions.
