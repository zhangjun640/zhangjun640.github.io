Education
======

* B.S. in Shandong, Shandong University, 2026(excepted)

Research Experience
======
* Prediction of RNA Modifications using Nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing Reads
* Jun. 2023 – Present:Research Assistant, Research Center of Software and Data Engineering
  * Processed all raw Nanopore Fast5 files, including base calling, re-squiggle operations, and signal-level analysis, with methylation site information fully extracted.
  * Extracted important features for RNA modification data through read alignment and signal segmentation.
  * Conducted site-level analysis of RNA methylation data, achieving accurate prediction of methylation sites.
  * Built a basic prediction model based on the transformer architecture.


* Single cell analysis of the impact of age on immune dysregulation and recovery induced by spaceflight  
* Jul. 2024 –Present: Research Assistant, Cheeloo College of Medicine 
  * Processed the single-cell sequencing data of OSD-402 from NASA GeneLab, completing all single-cell analyses including quality control, clustering, cell type annotation, subgroup annotation, cell communication, and pseudotime analysis.
  * Utilized Seurat, CellChat, monocle3, and other R packages to perform all of the above analyses, and currently in the paper writing stage.
  * The study found that old mice recover more poorly than young mice over the same period of time.
  * The study indicates that B cells, monocytes, and neutrophils are most affected.
 

* Prediction of EGFR Mutation Status in Lung Cancer Patients based on Clinical Data 
* Sep. 2024 –Present:Research Assistant, Cheeloo College of Medicine
  * Collected and processed multi-modal clinical data, including routine blood test results, CT images, and EGFR mutation status information.
  * Developed an ensemble learning model to predict EGFR mutation status, utilizing algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest and Gradient Descent.
  * Applied cross-validation techniques and predictive performance for model evaluation and validation.
  * Evaluated the performance of the model with dataset from an independent hospital.

* Multi-omics analysis of Biological Features of Spaceflight Across different Organs 
* Sep. 2024 –Present: Research Assistant, Cheeloo College of Medicine 
  * Collected transcriptomics and proteomics data from NASA GeneLab, performed batch correction for sample integration.
  * Analyzed transcriptomics of spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) groups to recognize spaceflight-associated RNAs across multiple organs including liver, spleen, muscle, kidney and eye.
  * Integrated multi-omics data to assess specific organ-level effects of microgravity, validating key findings through experimental data.
  * Identified tissue-specific spaceflight-associated RNAs/Proteins and integrated multi-omics data to serve as a reference to further understanding of biological features of spaceflight.
