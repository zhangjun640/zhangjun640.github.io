Education
======

* B.S. in Shandong, Shandong University, 2026(excepted)

Research Experience
======
* Prediction of RNA Modifications using Nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing Reads
* Jun. 2023 – Present:Research Assistant, Research Center of Software and Data Engineering
  * Processed all raw Nanopore Fast5 files, including base calling, re-squiggle operations, and signal-level analysis, with methylation site information fully extracted.
  * Extracted important features for RNA modification data through read alignment and signal segmentation.
  * Conducted site-level analysis of RNA methylation data, achieving accurate prediction of methylation sites.
  * I applied Multi-view Model to improve the accuracy of RNA methylation prediction, achieving a over 5% 
improvement compared to m6Anet in HEK293T dataset, providing a valuable tool for better predictions.


* Single cell analysis of the impact of age on immune dysregulation and recovery induced by spaceflight  
* Jul. 2024 – Present: Research Assistant, Cheeloo College of Medicine 
  * Processed the single-cell sequencing data of OSD-402 from NASA GeneLab, completing all single-cell analyses including quality control, clustering, cell type annotation, subgroup annotation, cell communication, and pseudotime analysis.
  * Utilized Seurat, CellChat, monocle3, and other R packages to perform all of the above analyses, and currently in the paper writing stage.
  * The study found that old mice recover more poorly than young mice over the same period of time.
  * This paper is currently in the process of being written.

 
* Metabolic redundancy of fatty acid desaturation and elongation promotes hypoxia-induced breast cancer stem cell enrichment 
* Jul. 2024 – Mar. 2025: Research Assistant, Cheeloo College of Medicine 
  * Performed functional analysis such as GO, KEGG, GSEA and GSVA to identify critical pathways influenced by hypoxia.
  * Used the Random Forest algorithm to analyze transcriptomics of hypoxia and normoxia groups, recognizing the hypoxia-associated breast cancer hypoxia signature.


* Prediction of EGFR Mutation Status in Lung Cancer Patients based on Clinical Data 
* Sep. 2024 – Present:Research Assistant, Cheeloo College of Medicine
  * Collected and processed multi-modal clinical data, including routine blood test results, CT images, and EGFR mutation status information.
  * Developed an ensemble learning model to predict EGFR mutation status, utilizing algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest and Gradient Descent.
  * Applied cross-validation techniques and predictive performance for model evaluation and validation.
  * Evaluated the performance of the model with dataset from an independent hospital.
