Education
======

* B.S. in Shandong, Shandong University, 2026(excepted)

Research Experience
======
* Prediction of RNA Modifications using Nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing Reads
* Jun. 2023 – Present:Research Assistant, Research Center of Software and Data Engineering
  * Processed all raw Nanopore Fast5 files, including base calling, re-squiggle operations, and signal-level analysis, with methylation site information fully extracted.
  * Extracted important features for RNA modification data through read alignment and signal segmentation.
  * Conducted site-level analysis of RNA methylation data, achieving accurate prediction of methylation sites.
  * Applied multimodal deep learning to improve the accuracy of RNA methylation prediction, resulting in an average accuracy improvement of 3% compared to EpiNano, providing a valuable tool for enhanced prediction.

* Prediction of EGFR Mutation Status in Lung Cancer Patients based on Clinical Data 
* Jul. 2024 –Present:Research Assistant, Advanced Medical Research Institute
  * Collected and processed multi-modal clinical data, including routine blood test results, CT images, and EGFR mutation status information.
  * Developed an ensemble learning model to predict EGFR mutation status, utilizing algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest and Gradient Descent.
  * Applied cross-validation techniques and predictive performance for model evaluation and validation.
  * Evaluated the performance of the deep learning model with dataset from an independent hospital.

* Multi-omics analysis of Biological Features of Spaceflight Across different Organs 
* Jul. 2024 –Present: Research Assistant, Advanced Medical Research Institute
  * Collected transcriptomics and proteomics data from NASA GeneLab, performed batch correction for sample integration.
  * Analyzed transcriptomics of spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) groups to recognize spaceflight-associated RNAs across multiple organs including liver, spleen, muscle, kidney and eye.
  * Integrated multi-omics data to assess specific organ-level effects of microgravity, validating key findings through experimental data.
  * Identified tissue-specific spaceflight-associated RNAs/Proteins and integrated multi-omics data to serve as a reference to further understanding of biological features of spaceflight.

* Integration of Spatial and Single-Cell Transcriptomics  
* Jul. 2024 –Present: Research Assistant, Advanced Medical Research Institute
  * Performed deconvolution analysis on spatial transcriptomics, revealing cell distribution and gene expression patterns across different spatial regions.
  * Utilized Python packages like Scanpy for clustering of single-cell transcriptomics, then annotating cell types by the atlas annotations.
  * Refined spatial transcriptomics data by aligning cell populations with spatially resolved gene expression, providing detailed insights into tissue composition.
  * Integrated spatial and single-cell transcriptomics to investigate cell communication, trajectory inference and cellular plasticity measurement.
