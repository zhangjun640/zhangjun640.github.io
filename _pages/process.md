## 🧬 Prediction of RNA Modifications using Nanopore Direct RNA Sequencing Reads  
**Research Assistant, Research Center of Software and Data Engineering**  
**Jun. 2023 – Aug. 2025**

- Processed raw Nanopore Fast5 data, including base calling, re-squiggle, and signal-level analysis, fully extracting methylation site information. Conducted site-level RNA methylation analysis and achieved accurate methylation site prediction.
- Applied a Multi-view Model to enhance RNA methylation prediction accuracy, achieving **over 5% improvement** compared with *m6Anet* on the HEK293T dataset.
- The core research output has been submitted as a manuscript to **Nucleic Acids Research (Under review).**

## 🚀 Single cell analysis of the impact of age on immune dysregulation and recovery induced by spaceflight  
**Research Assistant, Cheeloo College of Medicine**  
**Jul. 2024 – Aug. 2025**

- Processed single-cell sequencing data of OSD-402 and OSD-403 from NASA GeneLab, completing end-to-end scRNA-seq analysis, including QC, clustering, annotation, subgroup definition, cell–cell communication, and pseudotime inference.
- Utilized *Seurat*, *monocle3*, and additional R packages for the entire analysis workflow.
- The core output has been submitted as a manuscript to **npj Microgravity (Under review).**

## 🧫 Metabolic redundancy of fatty acid desaturation and elongation promotes hypoxia-induced breast cancer stem cell enrichment  
**Research Assistant, Cheeloo College of Medicine**  
**Jul. 2024 – Mar. 2025**

- Performed functional enrichment analyses (GO, KEGG, GSEA, GSVA) to identify hypoxia-regulated biological pathways.
- Applied Random Forest algorithms to hypoxia vs. normoxia transcriptomics to characterize hypoxia-associated breast cancer signatures.
- The core output has been submitted as a manuscript to **Science Bulletin (Submitted).**
