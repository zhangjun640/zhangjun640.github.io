Pharmaceutical management system: 
======
  * Tech Stack:JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Java, Shiro
  * Led the overall project architecture design and technology selection, implementing a decoupled front-end (Vue.js) and back-end (Spring Boot) solution.
  * Designed and implemented the security framework using Apache Shiro, delivering user authentication, session management, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
  * Developed and managed the core business modules, including backend APIs for drug information, supplier management, inventory (inbound/outbound), and sales statistics.

AI-Assisted Interview Platform:
======
  * Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, QLoRA, Ollama, HTML, Vue 3
  * Led the creation and open-sourcing of the world's largest Chinese interview dataset (150k+ entries) by scraping tech communities and generating high-quality Q&A pairs using multiple LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek), and published it on Hugging Face.
  * Directed the technology selection and fine-tuning of the AI interviewer LLM. Employed QLoRA (Unsloth) on a DeepSeek base model, training it on the custom dataset to specialize in generating interview questions, follow-ups, and automated scoring.
  * Designed and deployed the project's full-stack architecture: built the frontend application (Vue 3) integrating resume editing, AI polishing, and mock interviews; and deployed the fine-tuned model as an HTTP API service using Ollama.

Guess the numbers game:
======
  * This project implemented a number-guessing game with complete game design and implementation logic.
  * [GitHub Link](https://github.com/zhangjun640/Guess-Number-Game)

Solitaire: 
======
  * This project implemented a Solitaire game with a well-designed interactive interface and complete game logic.
  * [GitHub Link](https://github.com/zhangjun640/Solitaire)

Web crawler attempt: 
======
  * In this project, I used Python web scraping to extract data from a novel website and NASA's public database, successfully completing the entire task.

SNP-SNP_Prediction: 
======
  * In this project, I used the mutual information algorithm, and the power value in both the biallelic and triallelic models reached 1, meaning all the SNP loci were correctly identified with complete accuracy.
  * [GitHub Link](https://github.com/zhangjun640/SNP-SNP_Prediction)

Computational Optimization of Many Body Problems:
======
  * Project Goal: To optimize an N-body simulation program by addressing its $O(N^2)$ computational complexity.
  * Core Technologies: Utilized OpenMP for multi-core parallelization combined with SIMD (AVX/AVX512) instructions for vectorized computation.
  * Optimizations & Results: Enhanced memory efficiency through SoA layout and 64-byte alignment, achieving an 11.437x speedup on 32 cores while maintaining high computational precision.
