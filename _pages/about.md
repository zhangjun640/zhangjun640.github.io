I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Software](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Methylation Position Analysis, Machine Learning Applications in Biomedicine, Single-cell & Spatial Transcriptomics and Multimodal Data Integration.Looking forward, I am keen to explore Large Language Models (LLMs) in the biomedical domain, specifically aiming to develop novel models, such as Methylation-specific LLMs.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0EAV03MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from the WeiLab, [School of Software Engnieering](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University. I also receive guidance from [Prof. Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1ZtLyS0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at the [Advanced Medical Research Institute](http://www.amri.sdu.edu.cn/ywb.htm), Shandong University.    

I have a deep gratitude and love for my hometown,  [Zhangjiajie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangjiajie), a place renowned for its stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage. Growing up in such a beautiful environment has shaped who I am, and I hope to give back and support its future growth in any way I can.
