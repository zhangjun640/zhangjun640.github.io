My research interest includes Methylation Position Analysis, Machine Learning Applications in Biomedicine, Single-cell & Spatial Transcriptomics, Medical Image Analysis and Multimodal Data Integration.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0EAV03MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from the WeiLab, [School of Software Engnieering](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University.
