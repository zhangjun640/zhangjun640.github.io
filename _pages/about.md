I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Software](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Methylation Position Analysis, Machine Learning Applications in Biomedicine, Single-cell & Spatial Transcriptomics, Medical Image Analysis and Multimodal Data Integration.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0EAV03MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) from the WeiLab, [School of Software Engnieering](https://www.sc.sdu.edu.cn/), Shandong University. I also receive guidance from [Prof. Lu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1ZtLyS0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) at the [Advanced Medical Research Institute](http://www.amri.sdu.edu.cn/ywb.htm), Shandong University.    

As a [Tujia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%9C%9F%E5%AE%B6%E6%97%8F) person (Tujia language: Bifzivkar) in China, I have always been dedicated to advancing education and preserving the cultural heritage of my people. I deeply love my hometown, [Zhangjiajie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangjiajie), and sincerely hope for its continued growth and prosperity.
