Summer volunteer teaching in Zhangjiajie: 
======
  * As someone from Zhangjiajie who lives away from my hometown, Iâ€™ve always had a strong desire to give back to my community. In 2023, I decided to reach out to local schools in Zhangjiajie, hoping to set up a volunteer teaching program.
  * Luckily, I found a school where the principal was incredibly supportive of our idea. We instantly hit it off, and I quickly gathered a team of nine other volunteers from my university to join me in this journey. It was thrilling to set out together for Zhangjiajie!
  * I took charge of coordinating with the school, organizing the team, and teaching the students. I chose Python as the foundation for our lessons, aiming to introduce them to the world of computers and spark their curiosity about programming. We started from the basics, like variables, and gradually built up to creating a simple calculator with Python, drawing fun shapes with the turtle graphics, and helping them bring their ideas to life through code. It was such an amazing experience!

  * After two weeks of teaching, it was time to say goodbye. The students saw us off at the school, writing us letters of farewell. This truly was an unforgettable experience!
